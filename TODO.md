TODOs
=======

* extract_entities is better named as extract_all 

* extract_entity_from_uri: add a method to extract all triples for a specific URI (even if not in model) and instantiate RDF_Entity() so that it can be queried further 

* x.rdfgraph should be x.rdflib_graph

* x.properties => x.properties_all
* x.annotationProperties  => x.properties_annotation
etc..etc... (ONTODOCS dependency here though)
