### Prerequisites:
- Python (tested on 2.x or 3.x)
- A python package manager: [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).


### Installation:

Once you have a package manager installed, get OntoSpy from the Python Package Index:

```easy_install ontospy``` or ```pip install ontospy```

The python library, its dependencies and all of its command-line executables will be installed.

### Upgrading:
if youâ€™re upgrading from an older version, make sure you use the -U flag:
```
pip install ontospy -U
```
